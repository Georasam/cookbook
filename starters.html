             <p>1. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Cut the into quarters, slicing most of the way through but keeping the base intact. Squeeze the base of each fig to open it up, then wrap each one in a piece of parma ham, leaving the top open.</p>
             <p>2. Put in a baking dish, then dot with the roquefort cheese. Drizzle with the balsamic vinegar glaze and a splash of dry white wine, then bake for 20-25 minutes until oozing. Scatter with fresh basil and serve with crusty bread. </p>

             <h4>Method of cooking</h4>    
             <p>1. Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. In a separate bowl, add the yeast to the water and mix until dissolved. If using dried yeast, mix the yeast through the flour mixture.</p>
             <p>2. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the water, then use a spatula, dough scraper, spoon or your hand to bring the dough together to form a loose dough, mixing for a few minutes until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. If using a stand mixer, use the dough hook attachment to bring the ingredients together. You want a glossy dough with no lumps of flour in it.</p>
             <p>3. Drizzle 2 tbsp of the olive oil around the edges of the bowl and use a scraper or spoon to gently tease the oil around the edges of the bowl so it’s evenly distributed underneath and over the top of the dough.</p>
             <p>4. Put your hands under one side of the dough, then pull it up and stretch it over to the other side. Do this from the bottom, then the top, then from each of the two sides (this is considered a single fold and will trap layers of air within the dough). Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 minutes.</p>
             <p>5. Give your dough 3 more folds in the same way, resting for 30 minutes after each of the first 2 folds. After the third and final fold, move the dough to the fridge and rest for 10 minutes.</p>
             <p>6. Lightly oil a large baking tray with some of the remaining oil, then gently slide the rested dough into the prepared baking tray. Fold it in half (like a giant Cornish pasty) and massage the remaining olive oil into the surface of the dough, making sure it’s evenly covered. Press your fingers into the top of the dough to spread it out to fill the tray. Make sure you press over the whole surface of the dough (this will give your focaccia its dimpled appearance).</p>
             <p>7. Add your toppings (except the salt) and leave to rest for 30 minutes – see Make Ahead.</p>
             <p>8. When ready to bake, heat the oven to 220°C fan/gas 9 or as hot as it will go. Sprinkle the top of the dough with salt, then transfer to the oven and lightly spray the oven chamber with water or place a baking tray filled with 120ml water on the bottom of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes or until crisp and golden. Remove from the oven, brush with a little more olive oil, then cool and serve.</p>

                    <li>2-3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>

            <h4>Method of cooking</h4>    
            <p>1. In a large bowl, mix the onions, tomatoes, garlic and basil, taking care not to mash or break up the tomatoes too much. Add the balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix again. Cover and chill for at least an hour. This will allow the flavours to soak and blend together</p>
            <p>2. Slice the baguette loaf diagonally into 12 thick slices and lightly toast them until they are light brown on both sides. Serve the mixture on the warm slices of bread. If you prefer the mixture at room temperature, remove from the fridge half an hour before serving.</p>
