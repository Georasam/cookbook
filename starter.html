                 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 x 6-point lamb racks, French trimmed, skin on, room temperature
                    </li>
                    <li>1/4 cup (60ml) extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>100g toasted sourdough breadcrumbs</li>
                    <li>1 cup loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                    <li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 tbs Dijon mustard</li>
                </ul>
             </p>
             <h4>Method of cooking</h4>    
             <p>1.For the sweet and sour cherries, heat a large frypan with the oil over high heat. Add the onion, ginger and spice and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes until onion has softened. Add the cherries with the sugar and toss to combine. Drizzle over the vinegar with 1/3 cup (80ml) water and cook, tossing frequently for 3-4 minutes until the sugar has dissolved and cherries have warmed through. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cool completely. Just before serving, add the hazelnuts and eschalots and toss gently to combine.</p>
             <p>2.Preheat the oven to 220Â°C. Season lamb racks all over. Place a large oven-proof frypan with oil over medium-high heat. Sear lamb, skin-side down, for 5-6 minutes until the fat has rendered out and the skin becomes golden. Turn racks over so they are skin-side up. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20-25 minutes until cooked to your liking. Remove from the oven and rest 12-15 minutes before serving.</p>
             <p>3.Meanwhile, to make the crust, place the toasted breadcrumbs, parsley, garlic and zest in a bowl. Season to taste and toss to combine. Spread mustard over the seared skin and scatter over crust mixture, pressing firmly to ensure the crust adheres to mustard.</p>
             <p>When ready to serve, place the eschalot in a large bowl with the sweet and sour cherries and toss to combine. Transfer to a large bowl and serve alongside the lamb.</p>
