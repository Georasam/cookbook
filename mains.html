             <h4>Method of cooking</h4>    
             <p>1. Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>
             <p>2. Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>
             <p>3. Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
             <p>4. Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p>

                 <h4>Method of cooking</h4>    
                 <p>1. About 30 minutes before you want to cook, score both sides of the fish at regular intervals, insert a sprig of rosemary or fresh oregano, or both, in the fish’s cavity, and pour a mixture of olive oil, freshly squeezed lemon juice, salt and pepper over the fish. Allow the fish to marinate in this mixture, turning the fish several times so that the marinade penetrates evenly.</p>
                 <p>2. Then grill your fish over a hot flame, until nicely browned on both sides. Total time will depend on the thickness of the fish. The general rule of thumb is 10 minutes per inch (3 cm.) of thickness. But you will probably need more time for small fish, so that it has time to brown nicely. A minimum would be 5 minutes per side over a hot flame. If you have a larger fish that needs longer cooking, then use a moderate flame to avoid the skin burning. Take care with the tail, as well, as it tends to burn quickly; you can either cover it with aluminum foil or position your fish so that the tail gets only indirect heat.</p>   
                 <p>3. When the fish is fully cooked, place it on a serving platter, drizzle with best quality fruity olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then with a bit of finely chopped parsley. Serve your grilled fish with lemon wedges.</p>

                <h4>Method of cooking</h4>    
                <p>1. Heat the oil in non-stick frying pan. Tip in the carrot and cook for 5 mins to soften. Scoop out the tomatoes from the can and add to the pan, and cook for 5 mins more. Pour over the tomato juice and basil, then simmer for 15 mins. Whizz together in a blender until smooth. Can be frozen for up to three months.</p>
                <p>2. Heat through with the Multi mince. Cook spaghetti according to pack instructions. Reserve some of the cooking water, drain and tip the pasta into the pan along with the sauce. Toss together, thinning with pasta water, if needed, and serve with the extra basil leaves on top and the breadcrumbs.</p>
